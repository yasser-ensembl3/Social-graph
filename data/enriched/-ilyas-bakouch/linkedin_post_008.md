Last night I finished editing Part 2 of my Netflix architecture breakdown, and honestly… this one was fun.

It starts with that familiar moment: 10 p.m., popcorn in hand, you hit play and expect the video to load instantly. Simple on the surface. Underneath? A monster of distributed systems, encoding pipelines, custom CDNs, chaos monkeys, and data lakes the size of small countries.

In the video I dig into how:

- Netflix slices Hollywood masters into dozens of renditions
- Why they built their own CDN instead of paying Akamai
- How every pause/play you do gets streamed through Kafka and Flink in milliseconds
- And yes, why they literally kill their own servers for practice

If you like cloud, data, or just want to know what’s behind that little “tudum,” you’ll enjoy this.

(And tell me: would you survive a job interview where the system intentionally breaks during business hours? Because that’s daily life at Netflix.)
