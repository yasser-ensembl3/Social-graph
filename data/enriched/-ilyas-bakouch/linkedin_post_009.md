Met this biker at Mistral Café today: 23 years in the military and now a member of a biker's club against bullying: If your kid gets bullied at school, you call them and they'd escort him/her in a biker's cortège until the school's door in a clear display to the bully that this is our friend and is not to be messed with

I mean I'll slap the little shit myself if he ever dares to bully my kid 😂 but a great use of power if I ever seen one

(picture just for reference)
