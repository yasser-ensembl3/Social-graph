I never thought I'd own a coffee shop. 20 years in IT. 12 years in cloud. My career was stable, predictable, and… honestly, safe.

Then AI exploded. ChatGPT-3 dropped, and for the first time in my career I felt vulnerable. What if everything I knew became obsolete faster than I could adapt?

That fear pushed me to do something I never imagined: diversify outside tech.
So when a little café in Rosemont popped up for sale, I went for it. Spent Sundays behind the counter. Learned what it means to serve croissants instead of cloud solutions.

It's been chaotic, humbling, and one of the best decisions I’ve made.

It's been 1 year now, but I finally sat down to share the full story on YouTube: Episode 1 “Why I Bought a Coffee Shop (Cloud Architect to Entrepreneur)” is NOW LIVE

If you’ve ever thought about making a leap into entrepreneurship, or wondered what happens when you swap data centers for baguettes, this one’s for you
