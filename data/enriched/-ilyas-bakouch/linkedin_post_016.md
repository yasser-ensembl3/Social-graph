💭 Although AI tools like ChatGPT can help me write content instantly, there’s always a little guilt in my heart when I rely entirely on them. I believe tools should assist, but they can never erode my identity or personal journey.

This is my personal diary, a glimpse into my thoughts when I first started exploring DevOps. I was curious about the role, the culture, and how it connects development and operations seamlessly. To understand it better, I started with the Netflix story—a company that went from a fragile Oracle-based monolithic system to a resilient, cloud-native powerhouse on AWS. Their journey of embracing microservices, automation, continuous delivery, and chaos engineering was truly inspiring.

Special thanks to ByteByteGo, Netflix Engineering Blogs, ⚡️ iLyas Bakouch , Shubham Londhe, and yes, even ChatGPT—for guiding me, sharing insights, and helping me refine my understanding. ⚡

#DevOps is not just a methodology; for me, it’s a lens through which I understand how software can evolve, scale, and adapt—while preserving human creativity and curiosity.

Have a productive week ahead.
Happy Reading
