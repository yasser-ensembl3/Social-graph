You will be more likely to take action, and to follow through.\n \nFollow the link to start your transition to the Cloud Solutions Architect role: https://lnkd.in/ewz8sYMi","likeCount":7,"commentCount":0,"repostCount":0,"postDate":"2yr","action":"Post","author":"⚡️ iLyas Bakouch","authorUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasbakouch","profileUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasbakouch/","timestamp":"2025-12-04T04:12:18.271Z","postTimestamp":"2023-11-21T18:00:01.575Z"},{"postUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7132397200059326466","sharedPostUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7131004485803380737/","imgUrl":"","postContent":"🧙🏻‍♂️ SA Magic is a transformational experience that shows you how to transition to the Cloud Solutions Architect role with a complete roadmap. \nRead the review below 👇🏻 written by an alumnus and decide for yourself: SA Magic, all hype or the real deal?","type":"Text","likeCount":2,"commentCount":0,"repostCount":0,"postDate":"2yr","action":"Post","author":"⚡️ iLyas Bakouch","authorUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasbakouch","profileUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasbakouch/","timestamp":"2025-12-04T04:12:25.238Z","postTimestamp":"2023-11-20T16:00:06.026Z"},{"postUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7132329245489401857","imgUrl":"","postContent":"🎉 Enrollment is Now Open for SA Magic\n\nThis has been in the making for so long, but after 3 successful runs last year.

A young iLyas Bakouch, still a student with big dreams, doing my Master's in Distributed Systems. \n\nAround that time, INRIA announced a country-wide competition called \"Boost Your Code\". Think of INRIA as the French version of MIT in the US - it's a big deal.\n\nSo, of course, I couldn't resist giving it a shot. I skipped school for days and spent the time working on my project for the competition instead. To be honest, I couldn't care less for lectures, this for me was more important than anything I'd learn at school\n\nThe days blurred into nights, and before I knew it, weeks had passed. I hit submit on my project, and then all I could do was wait.\n\nFinally, a letter arrives. I'd secured the second spot. \n\nNow, coming second in a national competition does sound pretty good, and don't get me wrong, it was an enormous accomplishment...\n\nBut it stung. Second place felt more like first loser than first runner-up.\n\nStrangely, landing the 300th or 400th place would've been easier to swallow.\n\nThose spots would've suggested that I still had a long way to go, I had room to learn. But second?!! Why couldn't I be first? Where did I go wrong!! It was a strange mix of achievement and disappointment.\n\nBeing second meant I was so close yet so far from first, and that's a tough pill to swallow. I stepped up, took the microphone when they called my name, thanked everyone for the amazing opportunity, but I couldn't smile, the glory of second place got dim under the shadow of what-could-have-been.\n\nThese days I learned to be patient, I learned to think in terms of years instead of weeks or months, but the goal never changed. Being the first or nothing.","likeCount":59,"commentCount":7,"repostCount":1,"postDate":"2yr","action":"Post","author":"⚡️ iLyas Bakouch","authorUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasbakouch","profileUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasbakouch/","timestamp":"2025-12-04T04:12:25.247Z","postTimestamp":"2023-10-25T11:30:01.761Z"},{"postUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7122242770253029376","imgUrl":"https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4E22AQFkk6zn1GyzEQ/feedshare-shrink_800/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1698069680737?e=1766620800&v=beta&t=DaKcOOrpKOdD4XSy9EYdfowXIiCnhaVGmw8w80xwAfc","type":"Image","postContent":"Already 9 issues out the door since I started \"⛅️ Last Week in Cloud Weekly\" newsletter - Attached are the stats after 24h.\n\n- 1681 total weekly readers 💪🏻 (and growing)\n\n- The most visited resource so far is a link to Guille Ojeda's great write-up about architecting with AWS #Lambda which you can read here https://lnkd.in/e-HjxtTx\n\n- The 7 unsubscribes had all joined originally as part of my recent giveaway, so that's normal","likeCount":17,"commentCount":2,"repostCount":0,"postDate":"2yr","action":"Post","author":"⚡️ iLyas Bakouch","authorUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasbakouch","profileUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilyasbakouch/","timestamp":"2025-12-04T04:12:25.248Z","postTimestamp":"2023-10-23T15:30:01.300Z"},{"postUrl":"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7122220120445177857","imgUrl":"","postContent":"Looking to hire a content remixer: someone who would take one of my #YouTube videos and: edit it for Podcast, generate shorts and TikToks from it, generate and schedule multiple LinkedIn posts/tweets, repurpose it as a segment in my weekly newsletter…\n\nQuality is paramount.
